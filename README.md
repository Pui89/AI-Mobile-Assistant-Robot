## Product identity — four-wheel, dog-inspired mobile assistant

PUI89 NOMAD is a **four-wheel mobile assistant with a dog-inspired compact body language**. “Dog-inspired” describes the product's appearance and friendly mobile-assistant role; it does **not** mean a quadruped robot. NOMAD moves on four wheels and uses a retractable pull handle. Its engineering priorities are efficient rolling mobility, stable payload carrying, controlled turning, obstacle awareness and supervised indoor/outdoor use.

NOMAD is deliberately different from **PUI89 Sentinel**, which is a separate four-legged quadruped inspection robot. Sentinel uses articulated legs for research into stepping over obstacles and traversing selected uneven terrain; NOMAD uses wheels for practical rolling mobility. Do not depict or describe NOMAD with four articulated legs, and do not transfer Sentinel's legged-mobility claims to NOMAD.

Both products may share PUI89 Shared AI Core interfaces and evidence standards, but their chassis, locomotion, sensors, safety cases and validation plans remain product-specific. NOMAD's physical capabilities remain proposed until a prototype is built and tested.

## Compact product specification — proposed 6 kg design

| Specification | Proposed engineering target |
|---|---:|
| Complete robot mass | **Maximum 6.0 kg**, including battery, retractable handle, wiring and fixed sensors |
| Payload | **1.0 kg initial target**, carried separately from the robot's own mass |
| Body width | **30–33 cm** |
| Body length / depth | **35–40 cm** |
| Body height | **35–40 cm**, excluding the extended handle |
| Mobility | Four protected/recessed wheels; drive arrangement to be selected after torque, traction and braking analysis |
| First operating domain | Indoor, flat, controlled surfaces; owner-supervised |
| Later operating domain | Selected outdoor surfaces only after separate validation |
| Compute direction | CPU-first, low-power, local/offline-capable AI; no automatic model or package downloads |
| Human control | Manual override, physical emergency stop and conservative safe-stop behaviour |

The 6.0 kg limit is the complete robot mass, not the robot-plus-payload mass. The initial 1.0 kg payload target is additional; the design must therefore be engineered and tested for a total moving mass of up to 7.0 kg. The handle's extended height is excluded from body height, but its mass is included in the 6.0 kg robot limit.

**Status: PROPOSED / NOT MEASURED / NOT VALIDATED.** These are design targets, not measured prototype specifications. No physical NOMAD robot, payload rating, runtime, speed, braking distance, obstacle-clearance limit, ingress rating or field reliability is established.

### Preliminary 6 kg mass-allocation budget

| Assembly | Planning allocation |
|---|---:|
| Frame and enclosure | 1.4 kg |
| Wheels, motors and drivetrain | 1.2 kg |
| Battery and power protection | 1.0 kg |
| Compute and control electronics | 0.7 kg |
| Cameras and other sensors | 0.4 kg |
| Handle, wiring and safety hardware | 0.5 kg |
| Engineering allowance / mass reserve | 0.8 kg |
| **Complete robot mass budget** | **6.0 kg** |

This is a top-down planning allocation only. It is not a supplier-based bill of materials or measured component inventory. The engineering allowance is reserved within the 6.0 kg ceiling; it must not be treated as extra mass above the limit. Component selection must be supported by exact part numbers, verified mass, origin evidence, availability, compatibility and dated sourcing records before design freeze.

### First buildable product: NOMAD Prototype 1

The first physical prototype should prioritise a dependable supervised mobile base over complex autonomy:

- Four-wheel chassis with guarded wheels, low-mounted battery and a stable payload area.
- Appropriately sized motor/drive system, wheel encoders and a controller; final drive layout and torque remain to be calculated.
- Protected battery, fuse/over-current protection, accessible isolation, thermal monitoring and safe wiring.
- Physical emergency stop and manual recovery/control method.
- Basic camera observation and obstacle alerts; optional depth sensing only after compute, power, cost and provenance review.
- Battery/state telemetry and clear owner-facing status.
- CPU-first local software, with deterministic control and safety functions kept separate from AI perception.
- AI outputs are observations or bounded recommendations; they are not direct authority to drive actuators.

**Not in Prototype 1:** unsupervised owner-following, public-space autonomy, stair climbing, all-terrain travel, water crossing, waterproof claims, emergency response or autonomous road operation. These require separate engineering, risk assessment and validation.

### Engineering and validation gates

1. **Requirements and CAD packaging:** confirm body envelope, access for service, handle loads, payload location, centre of gravity and wheel guarding.
2. **Mass closure:** maintain a part-by-part mass ledger, including fasteners, wiring, connectors, guards, handle and battery; demonstrate a design total at or below 6.0 kg with the stated reserve.
3. **Mechanical and drive analysis:** calculate static/dynamic wheel loads, motor torque, traction, turning clearance, slope limits, braking and stopping distance for the 6.0 kg robot plus up to 1.0 kg payload.
4. **Electrical and thermal safety:** define battery chemistry/capacity only after runtime and power budgeting; verify fusing, isolation, charge protection, wiring, thermal limits and emergency stop.
5. **Software-in-the-loop:** test command limits, stale/missing sensors, communication loss, low battery, obstacle states, safe hold and recovery using deterministic tests and documented simulation.
6. **Controlled physical trials:** begin unloaded at low speed in a closed, flat indoor area; then increase payload and test braking, stability, turning, thresholds and endurance under supervision.
7. **Operating-domain expansion:** outdoor surfaces, rain/splash, dust, slopes and uneven ground each require their own acceptance criteria and evidence before being described as supported.

**Release rule:** do not publish a measured weight, payload rating, runtime, speed, slope limit, ingress rating or safety claim until the method, conditions, results and supporting evidence are recorded. Simulation and software tests do not prove physical performance.

## Open-source-first engineering

PUI89 prioritises open-source software, transparent licensing, reproducible workflows and evidence-led collaboration. Model weights, datasets, hosted services and hardware are assessed separately for provenance, licence terms, security, data handling, resource requirements and intended use. Public availability alone does not establish permission for reuse or commercial deployment.

## Hardware & Materials Sourcing

PUI89 uses a traceable sourcing workflow for materials, mechanical parts, sensors, compute, power and control components. See the [bilingual Hardware & Materials Sourcing guide](https://pui89.github.io/materials.html) for the process covering exact manufacturer/model identification, Thailand and international supplier discovery, country-of-origin evidence, dated pricing and availability, lead times, shipping, compatibility checks and verification gates. Product-specific candidates are added only when supported by evidence; research candidates are not purchases or validated hardware.

### Prototype materials & cost snapshot

**Planning allowance for one research prototype: ฿36,000–107,000.** This is a preliminary estimate from the [PUI89 project-specific BOM](https://pui89.github.io/materials.html#project-boms), not a supplier quotation or verified current market price.

Compact outdoor/mobile four-wheel assistant with a retractable manual handle; 8–10 kg target and 10 kg maximum design mass.

| Main item | Prototype quantity | Purpose |
|---|---:|---|
| Reinforced chassis/weather body | 1 set | Outdoor structure |
| Encoder drive motors | 4 | Four-wheel-drive candidate |
| Outdoor wheels + suspension | 4 + 1 set | Traction and vibration isolation |
| Retractable handle | 1 | Manual handling |
| RGB-D camera + 2D LiDAR | 1 each shared | Perception and navigation |
| IMU/position sensors | 1 set | Motion and location |
| Battery/BMS | 1 set | Protected power |
| Compute/motor control | 1 set | Reuse shared compute where suitable |

**Special engineering / purchase gate:** Validate frame strength, centre of gravity, handle locking, wheel/suspension loads, weather protection, battery safety and low-speed supervised stop behaviour. The 8–10 kg target and 10 kg maximum are design targets, not verified payload or performance.

**Shared engineering bench (tracked separately):** approximately ฿16,500–46,000 if the existing development computer is reused. This is a portfolio-level allowance for reusable compute, one RGB-D camera, bench power supply/multimeter, two microcontroller boards and reusable tools/wiring/adapters; it is not added to each project total. Allocate each shared item once, not once per product.

**Cost status:** exact manufacturer/model, manufacturing origin, supplier, stock, lead time and dated prices remain to be verified. Freight, insurance, duty, VAT, brokerage, local delivery, custom fabrication labour and certification are not priced here; calculate Thai landed cost only from dated quotations. Quantities are for one prototype; no purchase or supplier commitment is authorised. Software-first work can continue with available computing and appropriately licensed open-source tools before hardware procurement.

## Perception & Task Intelligence (PTI)

**Role in this product:** support supervised outdoor and mixed-environment mobility for the compact four-wheel NOMAD assistant. PTI is the shared PUI89 perception-and-task framework; the tasks below are research priorities, not validated all-terrain or autonomous capability.

**Priority perception tasks**
- Check camera/depth/IMU input quality, timestamps, calibration state and sensor availability.
- Detect people, objects, path boundaries and obstacles relevant to the planned route.
- Estimate terrain changes, slopes and traversability only when suitable depth/spatial inputs and validation evidence are available.
- Fuse localisation, inertial and perception observations; detect stale data, sensor disagreement and localisation loss.
- Identify routes or surfaces outside the validated operating envelope and request human guidance.
- Propose only bounded routes in a defined, supervised operating area; safe-hold when conditions are uncertain.

**Task flow:** OBSERVE → PERCEIVE → ASSESS → DECIDE → RESPOND → LEARN FROM EVIDENCE. Outputs support a human supervisor; they do not authorise unrestricted navigation or physical movement beyond separately validated safeguards.

**First evidence gate:** controlled indoor/outdoor route datasets and synthetic obstacle/terrain cases, then supervised low-speed trials only after independent hardware safety provisions exist. Measure obstacle misses, localisation error, stop response, recovery behaviour and compute/resource use.

**Not established:** all-terrain operation, stair traversal, public-road autonomy, payload or mobility limits, or field-validated navigation. See the [shared PTI specification](https://github.com/Pui89/PUI89-Shared-AI-Core/blob/main/docs/perception/PUI89_PERCEPTION_TASK_INTELLIGENCE_V1.0.md) (maintainer repository access required).

## Six Core Intelligence Groups — Product Allocation

PUI89 uses six shared intelligence groups across its seven independent products. This product allocation is a target architecture and capability map; it does not claim that every model, sensor, integration or physical function is implemented or validated.

- Vision Intelligence — image/video understanding, detection, classification, segmentation, tracking, depth and spatial cues.
- Audio Intelligence — speech recognition, sound/event perception, speaker diarisation where justified, audio-visual association, acoustic diagnostics and speech response.
- Multimodal Intelligence — context-aware fusion of vision, audio, text, video and authorised sensor/time-series data with provenance and uncertainty.
- Robotics Intelligence — robot/environment understanding, localisation, navigation, motion planning and manipulation where the product has suitable hardware.
- Action & Reaction Intelligence — task planning, bounded proposals, event response, prediction, recovery and escalation.
- Safety & Control Intelligence — independent permissions, operating limits, verification, human approval, fault handling, safe hold and emergency-stop boundaries.

### PUI89 AI NOMAD capability allocation

- **Vision:** Outdoor people, animals, vehicles, terrain, obstacles and traversability cues.
- **Audio:** Voice interaction, sirens/horns and outdoor sound-event awareness.
- **Multimodal:** Camera/depth/LiDAR/IMU/GNSS/audio/weather context fusion.
- **Robotics:** Supervised outdoor navigation, follow-me and safe-return planning.
- **Action & Reaction:** Terrain hazard, localisation loss, nearby traffic and motor/battery anomaly response.
- **Safety & Control:** Owner supervision, validated-area limits, obstacle stop and safe return/hold.

**Integration rule:** each product uses only the modules justified by its mission, data rights, hardware, compute budget and validation evidence. Model outputs remain observations or bounded proposals. Safety policy is product-specific and independent of model confidence. Unknown, stale, conflicting or out-of-scope inputs must be surfaced rather than guessed.

**Evidence status:** proposed capability allocation unless a separate implementation record, reproducible test or domain-specific validation explicitly says otherwise. Audio models, speaker diarisation, sound classifiers, VLM/VLA policies and robotics stacks require separate provenance, licence, compute, privacy and suitability review before adoption. No automatic model download or installation is authorised.

### A Compact Four-Wheel Assistant for Home, Travel and Everyday Life

**A mobile companion designed to help people indoors and outdoors.**

PUI89 AI NOMAD is an early-stage, owner-supervised compact four-wheel mobile-assistant concept with a rounded suitcase-style body. It is intended to support supervised everyday use, carrying belongings, travel and environmental awareness. These are design goals, not validated capabilities.

- **Repository:** https://github.com/Pui89/AI-Mobile-Assistant-Robot
- **Website:** [English](https://pui89.github.io/nomad.html) · [ภาษาไทย](https://pui89.github.io/nomad-th.html)
- **Separate indoor home-safety product:** [PUI89 AI HOME](https://github.com/Pui89/AI-Home-Safety-Robot) · [English website](https://pui89.github.io/home.html) · [ภาษาไทย](https://pui89.github.io/home-th.html)


> **Product boundary:** AI Mobile Assistant Robot is a mobile assistant concept for indoor and outdoor everyday use, travel and carrying assistance. HOME is a separate four-wheel indoor home-safety robot. The products may share versioned PUI89 AI Core contracts, but they are not one robot and do not share physical operating assumptions.

## AI Mobile Assistant Robot purpose

AI Mobile Assistant Robot is intended as an owner-supervised mobile companion. Proposed research areas include:
- Carrying shopping, luggage and personal belongings within a validated payload limit
- Owner-supervised accompaniment in suitable indoor and outdoor environments
- Travel, walking, park, station and campsite assistance concepts
- Indoor/outdoor scene and obstacle awareness
- Mapping and localization research, with safe-stop behaviour when uncertain
- Environmental observations when suitable sensors are selected and validated
- Offline-first operation and clear owner-facing reports

AI Mobile Assistant Robot is not an emergency responder or an unsupervised roaming machine. It must not enter hazardous areas merely to investigate. Carrying capacity, following behaviour, accessibility support and safe operation remain unvalidated design goals.

## Proposed operating workflow

Observe → check evidence quality → understand location and context → assess uncertainty and risk → choose a safe movement state → report to the owner.

The owner remains responsible for decisions. If localization, route safety or battery reserve is insufficient, the robot should stop safely rather than attempt an unsafe return or continue moving.

## Safety and resilience requirements

- Define and test separate limits for indoor floors, thresholds, stairs, people, pets, rain, dust, temperature, slopes, loose ground, water exposure, darkness, battery endurance and connectivity.
- Prioritize battery protection, electrical isolation, overcurrent protection, thermal monitoring and guarded wiring.
- Treat weather resistance, water resistance and fire performance as engineering requirements requiring specified tests; do not claim waterproof or fireproof performance.
- Never delay emergency response or substitute for certified alarms and qualified responders.
- Use human supervision, safe-stop defaults and clear uncertainty reporting.
- Protect location data and avoid unnecessary recording of people.

## Shared intelligence, separate product engineering

AI Mobile Assistant Robot may reuse PUI89 AI Core contracts (WorldState, Observation, ActionProposal and FailureReport), evidence provenance, uncertainty handling, safety gates, benchmark records and report formats. Its four-wheel mobility, indoor/outdoor navigation, sensor layout, environmental protection and risk assessment remain AI NOMAD-specific.

## Current development status

**FOUNDATION / SIMULATION-ONLY / CONCEPT.** The repository contains an early deterministic software foundation, documentation and automated tests. It does not establish a built robot, real sensor integration, trained AI model, validated locomotion, indoor/outdoor reliability, certified safety or real-world hazard-detection performance.

## local-first and supply-chain policy

External services and model downloads require prior origin, licensing, security and resource review. PUI89 excludes Chinese-origin AI models, providers and model-hosting services from its approved stack.

## Evidence labels

PROPOSED = planned; IMPLEMENTED = code exists; TESTED = automated test passed; SIMULATION-ONLY = synthetic inputs only; MEASURED = quantitative result with method; VERIFIED = reproducibly checked; NOT_VALIDATED = real-world performance not established.

See [Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md), [Safety Case](docs/SAFETY_CASE.md), [Intelligence Catalogue](docs/INTELLIGENCE_CATALOGUE.md), [Supply-chain Policy](docs/MODEL_AND_SUPPLY_CHAIN_POLICY.md), [Roadmap](docs/ROADMAP.md), [Water Resilience Standard](docs/PUI89_WATER_RESILIENCE_STANDARD.md) and [Resilience Standard](docs/PUI89_RESILIENCE_STANDARD.md).

## Hugging Face vision models — opt-in local integration

This repository now includes real Hugging Face checkpoint adapters in [`pui89_models/hf_vision.py`](pui89_models/hf_vision.py), with project-specific usage boundaries in [`docs/HUGGING_FACE_MODEL_INTEGRATION.md`](docs/HUGGING_FACE_MODEL_INTEGRATION.md).

- **OWLv2:** `google/owlv2-base-patch16-ensemble` for text-conditioned object proposals.
- **Intel DPT-Hybrid:** `Intel/dpt-hybrid-midas` for relative scene depth where appropriate; not calibrated distance or physical depth.
- **local-first default:** no packages or model weights are installed/downloaded automatically; CPU-only inference, local cache only by default, no hosted inference API or cloud GPU.
- **Evidence status:** adapter code is added; model inference and project-specific accuracy are NOT YET TESTED. Outputs remain uncertain observations for human review, never actuator commands.




---

## Security, malware and supply-chain protection

Security policy: [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md). Report suspected vulnerabilities privately; do not post travel routes, precise locations, credentials or private sensor records publicly.

Project-specific controls and review requirements:
- Treat GPS, location, environmental sensors, camera/audio, maps, downloaded files and external messages as untrusted inputs.
- Validate timestamps, source provenance, ranges, replay/stale data and offline behaviour.
- Never commit credentials, private travel histories, home addresses or identifiable recordings.
- Review packages, model files, simulator plugins and GitHub Actions for provenance, licence and vulnerability risks before adoption.
- AI suggestions must not directly control mobility, locks or safety-critical hardware; require human approval and safe-stop behaviour.
- Keep CI permissions minimal and never expose secrets to untrusted pull-request code.

A scan or passing test is evidence only for the checks actually run; it does not establish whether the repository contains malware or vulnerabilities.

## PUI89 seven-dimension quality recommendations

**Last reviewed: 8 November 2026 · Review month: November 2026**

This project uses the shared PUI89 quality framework. The indicators are guidance/status labels, not scores, certification or proof that work is complete.

## AI Engineering Intelligence & Outdoor-Robot Design

NOMAD uses a staged, owner-supervised engineering approach. Its current product target is a complete robot mass of no more than 6.0 kg including battery and handle, with a separate initial payload target of 1.0 kg. The proposed body envelope is 30–33 cm wide × 35–40 cm long/deep × 35–40 cm high, excluding the extended handle. All figures remain proposed and unvalidated.

**Project-specific priorities:** stable load distribution and low centre of gravity; guarded wheels; appropriate motor torque and braking; protected battery and thermal design; manual recovery; obstacle awareness; offline operation; maintainable enclosure; and clear safe-stop behaviour. Indoor controlled operation is the first physical validation domain. Outdoor use is a later, separately gated objective.

**Evidence gates:** CAD and mass ledger → mechanical/electrical analysis → deterministic software tests and documented simulation → supervised low-speed closed-area trials → payload, stability, braking, endurance and environmental validation. Proposed mobility limits are not established capabilities.
